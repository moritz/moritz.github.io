# Home of Moritz Lenz

Human, father, geek, software developer, software architect, author of books.

## Bio

My name is Moritz Lenz. I was born in 1984, and studied physics from 2004 to 2009, and finished with a Master with Honours from [Heriot Watt University](https://hw.ac.uk/) and a German "Diplom" from [Universität Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/).

Since 2012 I am a professional software engineer, and later adopted further responsibilities like software architecture, and training and enabling other developers.

Occasionally I present at conferences, company and community workshops and meetups and the likes.

I have been intermittently blogging since 2008, and started writing technical books in 2016.

Since about 2005 I have contributed to various Open Source projects, mostly around the [Perl](https://perl.org) and [Raku](https://raku.org) programming languages.

## Other Interests

Besides my interest in programming, Open Source, Software Engineering and Software Architecture, I pursue some other interests with varying degrees of enthusiasm and time commitment:

* Table Tennis since around 2005 (with a two-year pause starting 2014), currently at [SpVgg Greuther Fürth](https://www.tt-greuther-fuerth.de/), previously at TV 1848 Erlangen and TSV 1877 e.V. Gerbrunn.
* I am low-key enthusiastic about cooking and baking. See my [recipe collection (German)](https://github.com/moritz/moritz-rezepte).
* I sing in a choir
* I follow spaceflight and astronomy from a distance, watch live-streamed rocket launches and the like.
* I am interested in [Scientific skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_movement).
